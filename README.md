# TopicModelling-LSA-

## Project Overview
This project focused on topic modeling of health messages using a latent semantic analysis (LSA) approach. The primary purpose of this project was to conduct topic modeling on health messages using a latent semantic analysis (LSA) approach. This involved downloading a health news dataset for analysis, performing data cleaning to eliminate noise and irrelevant information, and integrating data from various sources to enhance the overall quality of the analysis. Subsequently, the project proceeded to perform topic modeling analysis using the LSA technique.

## Method
1. We downloaded the health news dataset for analysis, cleaned the data to remove noise and irrelevant information, and combined data from different sources to improve the quality of the analysis. 

2. After preparing the dataset, we performed topic modeling analysis using the LSA technique. In this phase, we performed several experiments with 5 to 10 topics, focusing on topic analysis to understand the most common topics in each category. This analysis provided detailed insights into the most relevant and frequently mentioned health topics in the news.

3. By comprehending the central themes in each category, the project aimed to facilitate the development of more effective strategies and policies for addressing prevailing health issues. In essence, the overarching goal of the project was to offer enhanced insights into the content of health news and to identify general trends in topics within the processed dataset.
